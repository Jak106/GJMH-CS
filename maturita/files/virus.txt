On a quiet road next to the busy Bordeaux beltway, a huddle of policemen watch
as a drone climbs into the sky to fix its glass eye on the main road.
On the ground, police captain Pascal Gensous scrutinizes the images
it sends down to the monitor.
“The drone is very useful because we can see dangerous drivers on the roads
without being seen by them,” he said.
Police in the Bordeaux area of Southwest France are pioneering the use
of drones to catch drivers violating traffic laws. They started in summer
and have already issued hundreds of fines thanks to the spy in the sky.
It is also a lot cheaper than helicopter surveillance that the police sometimes
use to nab traffic offenders. The drone has a clear view of the traffic
but the police are hidden behind trees. Today, they are going after truckers.
They’re watching out for dangerous behavior, like driving too close to the vehicle
in front or illegal passing. The police don’t have to wait long.
“A white truck with red and black letters on the side. Illegal passing,”
said Gensous into his walkie-talkie.
